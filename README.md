## My TextAdept Init Script
**What it does**
* Sets the theme to something good.
* Adds much needed extra space between lines.
* Adds line moving and scrolling a-la Notepad++
* Enables multi-caret editing, with multi-edit auto-complete and paste.
* Sets the tab width to 4 rather than 2.

**How to install**
* Place `init.lua` in `~/.textadept/`
* Done!
